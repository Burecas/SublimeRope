Auto Import
===========

SublimeRope offers auto importing features through Rope library. It looks for possible imports from the project starting with the prefix under the cursor.

In order to use auto import you should look for ``Rope: Import Assist`` in the Control Palette or just add a shortcut in your configuration. We provide a serie of possible :ref:`key_bindings` in this Documentation as well.

Future Plans
============

Improving the Auto Import feature is being considered by some SublimeRope contributors.

Some Considerations
===================

The list of modules that you will get when doing auto import is determined by the :ref:`cache_mechanisms`.
